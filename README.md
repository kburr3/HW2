# HW2

This repository contains my work for homework 2 in my STOR 390 class. 

This homework is meant to illustrate the methods of classification algorithms as well as their potential pitfalls. In class, we demonstrated K-Nearest-Neighbors using the iris dataset. Today I will give you a different subset of this same data, and you will train a KNN classifier.
